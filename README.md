A Chrome extension that automatically reconnects your Colab's ongoing session without clicking button.

Are you a budding Data Scientist? 

Love to use free resources? 

Require GPU for your Deep Learning projects? 

If 'Yes', then you must be using Google Colab Jupyter Notebook with free GPU and TPU services. And if you are an admirer of Colab (like me), then you must be dependending a lot on Colab Notebooks. 

Everything's Good about Colab, except one thing. It gets disconnected a lot and you need to manually click the button to reconnect continue running the session. This is annoying for a data scientist, as you can't babysit your session for 12 hours. So this chrome extension CoAuRe comes to your rescue.

Colab Auto Reconnect - automatically reconnects your ongoing session whenever it gets disconnected without any manual intervention. Now you can go for a good night's sleep without bothering about your Colab session getting disconnected for next 12 hours. 

If this free chrome extension helped you, then please give good ratings.
